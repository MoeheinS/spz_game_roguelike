  Item TODO:s
    Ladder: step over Lava / Pit terrain (TODO: add Lava terrain...)
      In practice lava terrain becomes a los-transparent wall that you get to phase through. Lots of shenanigans for little payoff
    Flute: Put certain monsters to sleep
      All non-deaf, corporeal, non-undead monsters. Is it worth? What range?
    Boomerang: Ranged attack (with stun?)
      Consumable item ranged attack, that spawns a Boomerang item on the monsters square or adjacent
    Mirrored Fullplate: reflect beam terrain
    Potion: heal to full on death
      Or other effects, such as + damage, + def, a burst of speed (5 actions / attacks)
      Or a cursed effect such as poison (hp to 1), blindness, weakness (-damage)
    Hammer: crush walls to boulders, boulders to dust
      In theory you could crushwalk your way to a stairs, 2 actions at a time
    Wad of cash: bribe certain monsters
      corporeal non-undead. Ideally they would join your faction, but that means implementing some sort of faction AI
      easy solution is to have them NOT attack you if they could; lasts until they take damage from any source
    Tower shield: block 1 attack per action?
      1v1 invincibility, makes a 2v1 a 1v1
    Horned helmet: bullrush ability
      Great for rapid traversal and/or paired with the lance
    Genocidal dagger: attacking a monster deals damage to the species? Killing 1 deals damage to species? Killing 1 kills species?
      Love it, should perhaps be the macguffin
    Lance: gain +1 damage for each turn you move in the same direction, lost on attacking or changing directions
    Ankh staff: place an ankh (wall?) that monsters cannot pass
      wall is perpendicular to the cardinal direction you cast it in, max of 2 walls
      Allows you to use pillars for some interesting plays
      You stepping on any ankh tile destroys them all (behavior similar to Hazard tile)
